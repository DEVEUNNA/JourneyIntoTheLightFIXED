BEFORE RELEASE 1.12 List

General important things:

Items:
All items need to be tested and checked that no crash occurs

Blocks:
remove unused blocks

Rendering:
Fix essence bar so that the HUD updates (maybe change it to be more like the xp bar and have it overlap it when being used, frees up space and allows for more precise mana consumption)

Registries:
Finish tweaking sounds

Structures:
finish loot tables

Dimensions:
Fix certain teleporters (corba specifically)

Entitys:
Fix bosses, ranged mobs and pets

All bosses suck. They're either too challenging, not challenging at all, or just repetitive and boring.

CODE:

Future plans:
Overworld biomes, dimension biomes, more staves and wands, End update
